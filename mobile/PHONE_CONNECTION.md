# QR Code for Phone - Quick Guide

## Method 1: Use URL Manually (Easiest!)

   ```
   › Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081
   ```

2. **Copy that URL** (the `exp://192.168.x.x:8081` part)

3. **Open Expo Go app** on your phone

4. **Tap "Enter URL manually"** (usually at the bottom or in settings)

5. **Paste the URL** and tap "Connect"

6. App loads! ✅

## Method 2: Fix QR Code

**Make sure:**
- ✅ Phone and computer are on **same WiFi network**
- ✅ Expo Go app is installed
- ✅ Camera has permission to scan QR codes

**If QR code still doesn't work:**
- Use Method 1 (URL manually) - it's more reliable

## Method 3: Use Tunnel Mode

If phone and computer are on different networks:
1. Press `s` in Expo terminal
2. Wait for tunnel URL
3. Use that URL in Expo Go
