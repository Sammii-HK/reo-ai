# QR Code for Phone - How to Connect

## Option 1: Use the URL Directly (Easiest)

In the Expo terminal, look for a line like:
```
› Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081
```

1. **Copy that URL** (e.g., `exp://192.168.68.113:8081`)
2. **Open Expo Go app** on your phone
3. **Tap "Enter URL manually"** (or "Enter URL" button)
4. **Paste the URL**
5. App loads!

## Option 2: Make Sure Phone and Computer on Same WiFi

- ✅ Phone and computer must be on **same WiFi network**
- ✅ If on different networks, QR code won't work

## Option 3: Use Tunnel (If Different Networks)

If phone and computer are on different networks:
1. Press `s` in Expo terminal to switch to tunnel mode
2. Scan QR code again
3. Works across networks (but slower)

## Quick Fix: Use URL Manually

**Just copy the URL from terminal and paste it in Expo Go app** - no QR code needed!
