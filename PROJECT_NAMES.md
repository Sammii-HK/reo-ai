# Project Names Clarification

## Your Setup

### Supabase
- **Project Name**: `reo-ai`
- **Database**: Connected ✅

### Railway
- **Project Name**: `friendly-motivation` 
- **Service Name**: `reo-ai`
- **URL**: `https://reo-ai-production.up.railway.app`

## Why Different Names?

Railway projects can have different names than their services. When you linked Railway, you saw:
- Project: `friendly-motivation` ← This is the Railway project name
- Service: `reo-ai` ← This is your backend service

## To See All Railway Projects

If you want to see other Railway projects:
1. Railway Dashboard → Top left dropdown
2. You'll see all your projects there
3. Each project can have multiple services

## Current Setup

✅ **Supabase**: `reo-ai` project  
✅ **Railway**: `friendly-motivation` project → `reo-ai` service  
✅ **Backend URL**: `https://reo-ai-production.up.railway.app`

Everything is connected correctly! The names don't need to match - what matters is:
- Supabase project works ✅
- Railway service works ✅
- Database tables created ✅

Let's test the backend now!
